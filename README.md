# The-Power-of-Plots
MatplotlibChallenge

This repository was created for DU Data Analytics Bootcamp homework on working with matplotlib.

In this challenge I use Jupyter Notebooks to analyze a dataset about mice reactions to differenct drug regimens that treat tumors. The script will use several Pandas and Matplotlib functions including groupby, plot, mean, sum, isin, plot, alpha, explode and others to provide analysis and insightful graphics on population statistics and reaction to each drug regimen.

It will also create a regression model, identify outliers and state the correlation coefficient of the data set.
